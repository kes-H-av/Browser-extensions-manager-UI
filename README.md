## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox & Grid
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

- Handling dynamic rendering using `fetch()` and `.map()` to display JSON data.
- Implementing filters and toggle buttons using event listeners.
- Creating dark/light theme toggle using JavaScript and CSS variables.
- Structuring clean, responsive UI using Flexbox and Grid.

### Continued Development

In future updates, I plan to:

- Save user preferences (theme, filters) using `localStorage`.
- Add animations for smooth UI transitions.
- Convert the project to React for better state management.
